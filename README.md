Things To Timeline Converter
=========================

Mac OS X application connects to [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) by Cultured Code via AppleScript and formats the information in your database into a tab-delimited file that can be opened in [Timeline 3D](http://www.beedocs.com/timeline3D/) or [Easy Timeline](http://www.beedocs.com/easytimeline/) by BEEDOCS, Inc. This provides an easy way to make a timeline chart of your tasks.
